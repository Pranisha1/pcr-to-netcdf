# pcr-to-netcdf
 This file converts PCR files for the ERA5 data and then converts them to NetCDF. 
 Steps:
* Define the filetype
* Select the data
* Since pcr file is in a different projection system, change it to match the NetCDF projection system that you want to compare with
* Change the reprojected PCR to the NetCDF file
* Save in a zip file to reduce the file size
* Add timestamps to the converted NetCDF file
* Combine them
 
#### The objective is to compare two NetCDF (ERA5 and KNMI-LENTIS)


 








### Errors encountered:
* First, the coordinate system between the LENTIS and ERA5 data is not the same. The ERA5 data is in WGS 84 / UTM zone 44N EPSG:32644 and LENTIS in EPSG:4326
* Second, when translating the grid extension of the file in WGS84 is changed to a larger extent thus NAN values are introduced in the cells. I tried copying the extent and defining the grids across the x and y axis but it didn't work.



## Objective

* Convert PCR files to NetCDF format.
* Ensure compatibility with ERA5 data (same coordinate system).
* Compare converted NetCDF files with ERA5 NetCDF.

### Steps

#### 1. Data Preparation
* Identify coordinate systems: Determine the coordinate system of PCR files (likely not WGS84) and the desired target system (e.g., EPSG:4326 for ERA5).
* Handle projection differences: Reproject PCR files to the target coordinate system using tools like GDAL or specialized software.
* Address grid extent issues: Ensure the reprojected data has the same spatial extent as the ERA5 data. Consider cropping or padding if necessary.

#### 2. Conversion to NetCDF
* Choose a conversion tool: Select a suitable tool like `cdo` or Python libraries (e.g., `xarray`, `netCDF4`) based on your preference and the complexity of your data.
* Define metadata: Provide essential metadata for the NetCDF file, including variable names, units, and time information.
* Create NetCDF file: Generate the NetCDF file using the chosen tool, incorporating the reprojected data and metadata.

#### 3. Data Comparison
* Align datasets: Ensure both NetCDF files (ERA5 and converted PCR) share the same spatial and temporal dimensions.
* Calculate metrics: Use appropriate statistical methods (e.g., correlation, difference, anomaly analysis) to compare the datasets.
* Visualize results: Create maps or plots to visualize the comparison and identify potential discrepancies.

### Challenges
* Coordinate system mismatches: Addressing differences in projection and grid extent is crucial for accurate comparison.
* Data quality: Ensure both datasets have consistent data quality and coverage for reliable comparison.
* Computational efficiency: Handling large datasets might require optimized algorithms and tools for efficient processing.

### Additional Considerations
* Data preprocessing: Consider applying necessary corrections or adjustments to the data before comparison (e.g., filling missing values, removing outliers).
* Visualization tools: Utilize tools like QGIS, Python libraries (e.g., matplotlib, cartopy), or specialized climate analysis software for effective data visualization.
* Error handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential issues during the conversion and comparison process.

By following these steps and addressing potential challenges, you can effectively convert PCR data to NetCDF format and compare it with ERA5 data for meaningful analysis.
